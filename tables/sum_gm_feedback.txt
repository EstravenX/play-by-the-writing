The GM finds this an excellent idea, because...
What a coincidence that PCs propose this now...
Someone is going to be very happy about this
Lucky day, PCs are rewarded, find loot, or win a prize
On spot, the PCs learn or make a breakthrough
Someone else actually does something similar
In the meantime... (a faction makes a smart move)
It turns out this won’t be possible at all, because...
PCs might want to reconsider that; its not too late
Not so fast, PCs overlooked something real bad...
Someone’s not going to like what PCs are doing...
What PCs did has a risk to trigger something bad
What PCs are doing is going to face opposition
Something else happens before PCs attempt that
Actually, that was a bad move; now it gets harder
