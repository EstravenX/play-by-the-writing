# Play by the Writing (Play-btw)
### by JeansenVaars

Play by the writing is a small application powered by [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) that enables rolling dice, 
random tables and playing solo RPG systems directly when writing with your keyboard. Just write down the magic 
keywords (listed below), and they will be replaced with the result of such command, wherever you are typing from.

To put it in plain words, for example, when you write down the command ‚Äú:qq‚Äù (a yes/no oracle), an answer text like
‚Äú[No]‚Äù or ‚Äú[Yes, but]‚Äù will appear. That‚Äôs it!

# Features

- Call your GM emulators right away from your note-taking application:
Mythic 2e, PUM, SUM, GUM, OPSE, MUNE, CRGE
- Roll dice anywhere in your system just with a short command,
like :rr2d6+1. ‚Üí 2d6+1: 11
- Seek random tables and roll on them super fast, getting the results in your text
- Use ChatGPT and Dall-E to interact with AI from anywhere (needs OpenAI account) with high levels of customization
- An insane amount of random tables is included to roll right away
- (Advanced) Use nested tables to roll many tables in one go
- (Advanced) Configure your own random tables to access them anywhere

# How to use?

1. Install Espanso (free) before you install Play by the Writing
2. Install Play by the Writing with either the installer, unziping, or compiling the source code yourself
3. Launch Espanso and play!

For using AI, after installing Play by the Way, place your OpenAPI API key in "<user_folder>\espanso\config\openai.txt"

Test if everything works by typing :qq, if you get an oracle yes/no answer, you're good to go! Have fun.

## Installable Version

If you are a Windows user, the recommended way to use this is with the installer found [HERE](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/play-by-the-writing)
There's a price tag on it to justify the work effort overall, for the installer. If you use the open source version, please consider a donation too.

## Open Source Version

The installable is compilable from the source code available [HERE](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/play-by-the-writing).
If you know some Python and want to fiddle with Espanso, the source code for this is Open Source and Free (consider a donation!)
Instructions included in the source code files.

# What is inside?

- An installer which will setup play by the writing for you
- An executable (Windows or Linux) that is run by Espanso to support dice rolling and random tables logic
- Other configuration files necessary for PlayBTW
- Random Tables as included and used by PlayBTW (plain text)
- Instructions in PDF format (README, INSTALL, KEYWORDS, LICENSE)

# Is this safe?
- Espanso itself is an open source application
- Play by the Writing is Open Source, you can compile it yourself if you don't trust me, or to compare it
- Microsoft Windows may consider PlayBTW unsafe, you'll have to trust me, and ignore the warnings or set an exception if necessary
- I am an indie developer; I do most of my stuff for [free and open source](https://github.com/saif-ellafi) - Including Mythic GME Tools for Foundry VTT
- I do this for love. But this took me quite a bunch of hours to get it right. This is why this time I decide to put a minimum price-gap for it üòä Take it as a contribution and a coffee for me

# Executable version instructions

The installer will install everything correctly by default, only change the installer path if you know what you're doing. Just press next until it installs. That's it.

## Installer details

Play by the Writing (Play-btw) files go inside the Espanso's user config directory. **IMPORTANT:** Config directory is **NOT** the same as installation directory.

For example, if you install Espanso on the F:/ drive, the **config** directory will still be on the Windows installation drive, where your Documents and user files are located.

The installer will identify this location automatically, so normally you don't have to switch the path installation of Play by the writing.

## Microsoft Windows (10+)

### Installer

1. Make sure Espanso works fine in your system and starts and works correctly (test with `:espanso`).
2. Download the Windows installer executables
3. Follow the installer instructions. By default, the installer should point to Espanso config folder: 
`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\espanso\`. Adjust if it is different.

## Linux

1. Make sure your Espanso installation is valid and espanso starts and works correctly (test with `:espanso`).
2. Download the Zip packages for Linux (either base or base with AI)
3. If using default paths, this should just work: `unzip ~/Downloads/PlayBTW_v2_06_base_with_ai.zip -d ~/.config/espanso/`

### AI Complete errors

If you get any errors when using `aicomplete` keyword, it may be due to missing clipboard mechanisms.
Install `xclip` or learn more about it here: https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#not-implemented-error

That‚Äôs it. See the keywords list below in this document.

# Customization and Advanced usage

## Match files

There are many files with `.yml` extension inside the `match` folder. Open with a text editor and change the lines 
that start with `:` in order to change their command keyword.

Some entries point to `table` (or `wtable` for weighted tables) which follow with a table name. This table name 
is the file name within the folder `tables`, and you can append with comma more than one, i.e. `table1,table2`

Understanding this, will allow you to copy these segments to create your own commands with your own tables!

## Table customization

There are two types of tables. Ones ending in `.txt` (simple tables) and others in `.psv` (weighted tables). Check
the ones available in the folder `tables` for examples of each.

## Nested tables

You can nest table rolls within others, by utilizing the format `{{table_simple_name}}` or `w{{weighted_table_name}}`
where the table name refers to the file name. You can use these however you like, and even build sentences with more
than one of them, i.e. `Hello {{table_1}}, I hope you had a great {{table_2}}!`
