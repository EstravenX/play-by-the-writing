You receive a formal request, a petition, a royal mandate
Someone invites you to a private meeting, it’s important
Someone made a great sacrifice today; it can’t be for nothing
You found something that could change it everything…
Something happened that it now became very personal
Something bad happened, related with the big problem
It’s a life-or-death matter, someone can be in great danger
Desperate request from someone who really needs it
It’s an order. You might not want to, but you have no choice
Someone with strong network, connections, makes an offer
A faction could use your help, they are willing to pay
Conflict reached a certain state, something has to be done
You are being watched, following, conspiracy perhaps?
A paid job, there’s a lot of gold/money/wealth involved
Found a map with instructions, or a secret location
You were in the wrong place, at the wrong time
Family petition, either of your own, or an important one
Found a dead body, very strange, what happened?
You got attacked, endangered, why? What do they want?
There is a conflict, perhaps moral, you have to pick a side
