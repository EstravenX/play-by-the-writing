Situation for what PCs do worst, vulnerability
Resist, endure, withstand, fortitude test, hold on!
Push, kick, smash, pull, throw, lift, move
Get over someone, make them, the hard way
They are too many, another way, trick them
Move, quick, run, quickly! watch out!
Jump, crawl, squeeze, climb, stretch, swim, air
Only a specialist or expert can do, setting specific
Better not to be detected, guards, sentinels
Test of spirit, will, mentality, wits, courage
Locked out, to steal, watched, protected
Dodge, evade, run, act quickly, hurry up
It’s here, must be, have you seen, heard that?
Test of pilot, drive, handle, ride, control, manage
Low morale, scared, uninspired, unwilling
Trace, footstep, supplies, survive, fetch, collect
What is that? Historic, cultural, weird, magical
It’s broken, not working, failing, erratic, jammed
Injured being, person, in pain, hurts, sick, poisoned
Situation for what PCs do best or are good at
