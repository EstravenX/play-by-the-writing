Remains silent, looking at you with indifference
Ignores you intentionally or avoids conversation
Looks at you disrespectfully or in a rude manner
Holds distance, with safety or concern towards you
Evades you, tries not to be identified, no eye content
Despite unliking you, they remain calm and respectful
Approaches in a taunting manner, showing strength
Acts defensively, looking carefully at your moves
An uncomfortable look, unhelpful and unwelcoming
Assaults verbally or physically, non-lethal aggression
