# Play by the Writing (Play-btw)
### by JeansenVaars

Play by the writing is a small application powered by [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) that enables rolling dice, 
random tables and some solo RPG systems directly when writing with your keyboard. Just write down the magic 
keywords (listed below) and they will be replaced with the result of such command.

To put it in plain words, for example, when you write down ‚Äú:qq‚Äù it will be replaced with an Oracle Yes/No question 
‚Äú[No]‚Äù , basically with an answer that could also be ‚Äú[Yes, but]‚Äù. That‚Äôs it!

# How to use?

## Installable Version

If you are a casual Windows user, I have put the installable version available to download [HERE](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/play-by-the-writing)

To use it, you will have to install [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) (free) and learn where Espanso's user folder 
is located. In such folder you will be extracting the zipped download and execute Espanso so this plugin is loaded. 
Step by step instructions included.

## Open Source Version

Follow the instructions in README.md to compile the Python scripts into an executable that you can run, then place the dist
files inside Espanso user directory (not the install directory!).

# What is included?

- **Example kit**: Test before you buy. Once installed, by writing `:example` you should see a happy output.
- **Core kit**: Includes dice rolling, random tables, weighted tables, [Mythic GM Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator) (tables not included, user to upload them), [Plot Unfolding Machine (PUM)](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/plot-unfolding-machine), [Scene Unfolding Machine (PUM)](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/scene-unfolding-machine) and [One Page Solo Engine (OPSE)]((https://inflatablestudios.itch.io/one-page-solo-engine)) keywords
- **AI kit (Paying 5+ EUR)**: Includes Core kit + [OpenAI integration](https://beta.openai.com/playground) 
- auto-completes text for you based on context, using artificial intelligence/

# What is inside?

- Espanso‚Äôs files that make this application work with Espanso
- An executable (Windows or Linux) that is run by Espanso to support advanced functions
- Random Tables as included or used by any of the Play-btw modules
- Instructions in PDF format (README, INSTALL, KEYWORDS, LICENSE)

# Is this safe?
- Espanso is an open source application. I only wrote the logic to roll dice and random tables with Espanso.
- If you are a software developer, you can go ahead and learn Espanso. I recommend it. This package is for the out-of-the-box experience.
- Executables for Windows and Linux, meant to be of ease of use
- I am an indie developer; I do most of my stuff for [free and open source](https://github.com/saif-ellafi) - Including Mythic GME Tools for Foundry VTT
- I do this for love. But this took me quite a bunch of hours to get it right. This is why this time I decide to put a minimum price-gap for it üòä Take it as a contribution and a coffee for me

# How to install

Play by the Writing (Play-btw) files go inside the Espanso's user config directory. **IMPORTANT:** Config directory is **NOT** the same as installation directory.

For example, if you install Espanso on the F:/ drive, the **config** directory will still be on the Windows installation drive, where your Documents and user files are located.

The installer will identify this location automatically, so normally you don't have to switch the path installation of Play by the writing.

## Windows

### Installer

1. Make sure Espanso works fine in your system and starts correctly.
2. Download the Windows installer executables
3. Follow the installer instructions. By default, the installer should point to Espanso config folder: 
`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\espanso\`. Adjust if it is different.

## Linux

1. Make sure your Espanso installation is valid and espanso starts correctly
2. Download the Zip packages for Linux (either base or base with AI)
3. If using default paths, this should just work: `unzip ~/Downloads/PlayBTW_v1_11_base_with_ai.zip -d ~/.config/espanso/`

### AI Complete errors

If you get any errors when using `aicomplete` keyword, it may be due to missing clipboard mechanisms.
Install `xclip` or learn more about it here: https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#not-implemented-error

That‚Äôs it. See the keywords list below in this document.

# Keywords List

The keyword column is what you simply write in your keyboard, to get it replaced with an output (usually, at random).

**Note:** There are some `.` Surrounding certain commands. These represent user input and must be written down to denote the ending.

2. Go to your account settings and copy the API Key
3. Go to espanso settings folder inside the config folder
4. Paste the API Key in the file called openai.txt
