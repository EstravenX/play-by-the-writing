Oppression, tyranny, there’s a problematic leader, the situation is dire
High crime, violence, murders, gangs, mobs, anarchy, there is no law
Something extremely important, or valuable, is lost, or has been stolen
Common enemy, global threat building up, and is going to affect us all
There is a confrontation of two local factions for power, enemies within
Natural disaster, a catastrophe, terrible weather, doom, damage control
Plague, curse, damnation, sickness, disease, we are helpless, we are dying
Secret organizations, rumors, intelligence, espionage, we’re being watched
What used to work isn’t working anymore, failure, ignorance, powerless
Since an object was discovered or brought here, everything is wrong
Large scale conflict, war, lack of supplies, hardship, need to work together
Endangered tribe, species, creature, animals, or a similar vulnerable group
Kidnapping, disappearances, it matters; these are valuable people to us
Corruption everywhere, tax pressure, hunger, injustice, oppression
Trade routes troubled, lack of supplies, a siege, raiders, pirates, monsters
Weird event happened, phenomenon, feels very strange, something not right
Lack of good morals, segregation, hunger, poverty, the rich and the poor
Uprising, rebellion, revolution, riots, the people, bring the powerful down
Chaos, despair, pandemonium, outsiders, aliens, survival, the apocalypse
Religious oppression, holy war, inquisition, extremists, prophecies, divine
