Lost trace
Too dangerous
Tightly defended
Gone for good
Got anticipated
Too late, missed
Misfortune
Wrong, bad intel
Broken, damaged
No longer valid
Area is blocked
Now impossible
Government, law
Now unattractive
Not a good idea
It was a mistake
Destroy, sabotage
Reinforced, fortify
Claimed, sold
Change of plans
