Oppression, tyranny, there’s an annoying leader, it is terrible
High crime, violence, murder, injustice, nobody acting
Something extremely important or valuable got lost, or stolen
Common enemy, a threat is building up, and is going to affect us all
There is a huge confrontation of forces that compete for power
Natural disaster, a catastrophe stroke, there are sequels, side-effects
Plague, curse, damnation, sickness, disease, we can’t help it
Secret organizations, rumors, intelligence, espionage, we’re being watched
What used to work isn’t working anymore, failure, damage, are we doomed?
Since an object was discovered or brought here, everything is wrong
Conflict, war, we are all affected by it, we need to work together
Endangered tribe, species, creature, animals, or similar vulnerable group
Kidnapping, someone disappeared, it matters. They have to be rescued.
Corruption everywhere, we are not safe, law is weak, military is non-existent
Trade route compromised, business is terrible, resources gone
Weird event happened, phenomenon, feels very strange, something not right
Total extinction, annihilation, what is going on, what are our morals?
Uprising, rebellion, revolution, freedom, bring the powerful down, lost battles
Chaos, despair, pandemonium, order no longer, anarchy, lack of authority
Catastrophe damage control, survival, doing what we can, it is not enough
