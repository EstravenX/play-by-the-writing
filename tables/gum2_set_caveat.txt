We don’t know where the target is
Target is constantly moving, unpredictable
Someone else getting involved
They know about us, or are expecting us
Got competition, be careful, stop them
There are dangerous traps
They have powerful soldiers or agents
The law, police, or official side against us
A family got involved (is it yours?)
We are missing some names
Too many uncertainties, stay low profile
No killings (at least no innocent’s lives)
We know where, but hard to get there
They have network, eyes and ears, agents
Someone powerful is behind everything
Legendary enemy helping on their side
Hazardous location conditions
No known vulnerabilities, needs intel
We aren’t ready or strong, yet
We are under time pressure
