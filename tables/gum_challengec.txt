It’s broken, must restore
What is that smell?
It’s about to fall!
What are they doing here?
What is that?
That is treason!
What is that sound?
Did you see that?
An explosion
Something starts failing
Never seen that before
They need help!
It’s full of traps
Are they trying to trick us?
This needs careful study
This is so weird, magic?
Someone was here
They are way too many
Advanced technology
This should be stopped
