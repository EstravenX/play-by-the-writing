We don’t know where the target is
The target is constantly moving
Someone else got involved, but who?
They know, or are already expecting us
We’ve got competition, be careful
There are traps, it is quite dangerous
They have large, or powerful army
Law and government are not in our side
Family is involved (ours, or other’s)
We are missing some names, information
We have to keep this very low profile
No killings (or at least no innocent losses)
We know where, but it is hard to get there
They have a complex network, agents
Someone especially powerful is behind it
A legendary enemy is on their side
Location conditions extremely hazardous
No known vulnerability, or safe approach
We aren’t yet ready, strong, or well-armed
We are under a time limit, hurry up
